# Generating Tabular Using Sequential FeatureForestFlow

## Description
ForestFlow matching is powerful method for tabular data generation.  This method uses a XGBOOST model for predicting a velocity vector from the initial data, that will be used to seek for a flow (map that is smooth and differentiable that is generated by a velocity vector field) that will connect a noisy vector to the target distribution. This project introduces Sequential FeatureForestFlow (S3F),  an extension of Forest flow, that  fosters a better data generation quality and speed. S3F uses a XGBOOST model to predict a velocity vector for each variable of the initial data in an progressive way (generate variable 2 based on information from variable 1  and so fourth). This method guarantees better performances using heterogenuous data than ForestFlow prospects a novel style objective for diffudion models.

For better understanding of this code, I have designed a simpler version on [Google Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13JOngqBCCOZc0ixlmDmLcIRPPljHyfvv/view?usp=sharing)

## How to use this repository
 ### List of important hyperparameters

* K_dpl: is the number of time we duplicate our data| Its default value is 100
* mask_cat: is the mask for categorical data (list containing True for categorical and False for Continuous)
* N: is the number of noise level we are dealing with, its default value is 50
 solver_type: takes two values: {Euler: for Euler solver or RG4: for Runge Kutta solver}
* model_type: specifies whether we use the mixed model (HS3F regressor and classifier) or regressor only CS3F.
* n_batch: is the number of mini batch| default value is 0| If >0 use the data iterator with the specified number of batches 
* n_jobs: specifies the number jobs you wish to exucute with your computing cores (-1 uses everything possible)
* one_hot_encoding=False: Determine whether or not we will use one hot encoding (takes argument True or False)| But this is not necessary.
* arg1 and arg2 are respectively, the remaining hyperparameter for tunning the regressor and the classifier ( We did not consider all the argument for our Xgboost regressor and classifier, ythe user will define them personnally if needed)


### Cloning the Repository

To clone this repository to your local machine, use the following command:

*  git clone https://github.com/AngeClementAkazan/Sequential-FeatureForestFlow.git 
<!-- * cd Forest-FLow-Based-Variable-Sampling  -->

### Very mportant point
* Your dataset needs to be in numpy format. If you're using a pandas dataset, you can convert it to numpy format by using the command `dataset_numpy = dataset.to_numpy()`. Additionally, it's acceptable for the dataset to include missing values, the code contain a data processing part.
* The method uses a version of XGboost whose classifier models, demand that the class of each of the categorical variables of your  must have classes from {0,..., N}. Make sure you label encode your data.

<!-- You can either set the  variable `Use_OneHotEnc` to `True` or before you input your model you can use an appropriate encoding method to respect this constraint. -->
