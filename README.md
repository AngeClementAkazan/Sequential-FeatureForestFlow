Link to the paper: [Generating Tabular Using Heterogeneous Sequential FeatureForestFlow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15516)
## Description
ForestFlow matching is a powerful method for tabular data generation.  This method uses an XGBOOST model for predicting a velocity vector from the initial data that will be used to seek a flow (map that is smooth and differentiable that is generated by a velocity vector field) that will connect a noisy vector to the target distribution. This project introduces Heterogeneous Sequential FeatureForestFlow (HS3F) and its variants (CS3F), Heterogeneous sequential feature forest Flow (HS3F) extends ForestFlow  through an explicit mechanism to handle heterogeneity. HS3F processes data sequentially (feature after feature). This allows us to generate continuous features using FF, but handle categorical features using a (Xgboost) classifier. Categorical features are generated by randomly sampling from the probabilities of the learned classifier, which massively improves speed and closeness to the real data distribution.

## How to use this repository
 ### List of important hyperparameters      
 <pre> 
* label_cond=False, #Boolean argument that specifies wether or not we use label-based conditional generation 
* duplicate_K= 100 #is the number of time we duplicate our data.
* mask_cat: #is the mask for categorical data (list containing True for categorical and False for Continuous).
* N=50 #is the number of noise level we are dealing with.
* cat_indexes=[], #Vector indicating which column is categorical/binary (the classes must be under the form [0,1,...,J]) if not, use label encoding before using your data.
* int_indexes=[], #vector which indicates which column is an integer (ordinal variables such as number of cats in a box).
 solver_type= "RG4" #takes two values: {"Euler": for Euler solver or "Rg4": for Runge Kutta solver}.
* model_type= 'HS3F'; #specifies whether we use the mixed model (`"HS3F"`:regressor and classifier or `"CS3F"`: regressor only).
* n_batch= 0 #is the number of mini batch | If >0 use the data iterator with the specified number of batches.
* n_jobs= -1, #specifies the number jobs you wish to exucute with your computing cores (-1 uses everything possible).
* one_hot_encoding= False: #Determine whether or not we will use one hot encoding (takes argument True or False)| but changing this is not necessary.
* t_0=1e-3, # Time intialization.
* seed= 0 #random seed value.
* max_depth= 7 #max depth of the tree; recommended to leave at default.
* n_estimators= 100 #number of trees per XGBoost model; recommended to leave at default.
* arg1 and arg2 are respectively, the remaining hyperparameter for tunning the regressor and the classifier ( We did not consider all the argument for our Xgboost regressor and classifier, ythe user will define them personnally if needed).

### Work With Repository
1. Cloning
To clone this repository to your local machine, use the following command:
    * git clone https://github.com/AngeClementAkazan/Sequential-FeatureForestFlow.git
    * navigate into the code folder using "cd Sequential-FeatureForestFlow"
2. Create a virtual environment (You should create an virtual environment to avoid any dependency issues [More information about virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html))
    * python -m venv name_of_your_environment # Create your virtual environment
    * source myenv/bin/activate  # Use this to activate your virtual environment if you work on macOS/Linux
    * myenv\Scripts\activate     # Use this to activate your virtual environment if you work  Windows
    * pip install -r requirements.txt # Install all the needed libraries
3. Running all the model for all the data after cloning
    * To run this script, in your terminal run this:  `python -m unittest Test_Model.Test_class.test` (make sure you change the argument `parent` in the Test_Model.py before running)
4. Reproduce the iris and 2 Moons plots 
    * Use the notebook `Iris_Plot.ipynb`
5.  Navigating into the Seq3F folder where you can access useful functions
    * cd Seq3F 
### Important Notes
* Your dataset needs to be in numpy format. If you're using a pandas dataset, you can convert it to numpy format by using the command `dataset_numpy = dataset.to_numpy()`. Additionally, it's acceptable for the dataset to include missing values, the code contain a data processing part.
* The method uses a version of XGboost whose classifier models, demand that the class of each of the categorical variables of your  must have classes from {0,..., N}. Make sure you label encode your data.

<!-- You can either set the  variable `Use_OneHotEnc` to `True` or before you input your model you can use an appropriate encoding method to respect this constraint. -->
