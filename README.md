# Generating Tabular Using Sequential FeatureForestFlow

## Description
ForestFlow matching is powerful method for tabular data generation.  This method uses a XGBOOST model for predicting a velocity vector from the initial data, that will be used to seek for a flow (map that is smooth and differentiable that is generated by a velocity vector field) that will connect a noisy vector to the target distribution. This project introduces Sequential FeatureForestFlow (S3F),  an extension of Forest flow, that  fosters a better data generation quality and speed. S3F uses a XGBOOST model to predict a velocity vector for each variable of the initial data in an progressive way (generate variable 2 based on information from variable 1  and so fourth). This method guarantees better performances using heterogenuous data than ForestFlow prospects a novel style objective for diffudion models.

## How to use this repository
 ### List of important hyperparameters           
* K_dpl= 100 #is the number of time we duplicate our data
* mask_cat: #is the mask for categorical data (list containing True for categorical and False for Continuous)
* N=50 #is the number of noise level we are dealing with
* cat_indexes=[], #Vector indicating which column is categorical/binary (the classes must be under the form [0,1,...,J]) if not, use label encoding before using your data.
* int_indexes=[], #vector which indicates which column is an integer (ordinal variables such as number of cats in a box)
 solver_type= "RG4" #takes two values: {"Euler": for Euler solver or "Rg4": for Runge Kutta solver}
* model_type= 'HS3F'; #specifies whether we use the mixed model (`"HS3F"`:regressor and classifier or `"CS3F"`: regressor only.
* n_batch= 0 #is the number of mini batch | If >0 use the data iterator with the specified number of batches 
* n_jobs= -1, #specifies the number jobs you wish to exucute with your computing cores (-1 uses everything possible)
* one_hot_encoding= False: #Determine whether or not we will use one hot encoding (takes argument True or False)| but changing this is not necessary.
* seed= 0 #random seed value
* max_depth= 7 #max depth of the tree; recommended to leave at default
* n_estimators= 100 #number of trees per XGBoost model; recommended to leave at default
* arg1 and arg2 are respectively, the remaining hyperparameter for tunning the regressor and the classifier ( We did not consider all the argument for our Xgboost regressor and classifier, ythe user will define them personnally if needed)


### Work With Repository
1. Cloning
To clone this repository to your local machine, use the following command:
    * git clone https://github.com/AngeClementAkazan/Sequential-FeatureForestFlow.git 
    * pip install -r requirements.txt (Installing requirements) 
2. Running all the model for all the data after cloning
    * To run this script, in your terminal run this:  `python -m unittest Test_Model_.Test_class.test`
3. Reproduce the iris plot 
    * Use the notebook `Iris_Plot.ipynb`
4.  Navigating into the Seq3F folder where you can access useful functions
    * cd Seq3F 
### Very mportant point
* Your dataset needs to be in numpy format. If you're using a pandas dataset, you can convert it to numpy format by using the command `dataset_numpy = dataset.to_numpy()`. Additionally, it's acceptable for the dataset to include missing values, the code contain a data processing part.
* The method uses a version of XGboost whose classifier models, demand that the class of each of the categorical variables of your  must have classes from {0,..., N}. Make sure you label encode your data.

<!-- You can either set the  variable `Use_OneHotEnc` to `True` or before you input your model you can use an appropriate encoding method to respect this constraint. -->
